# Introduction

Welcome to Bitchain's API documentation! Bitchain Network is a simple, mostly RESTful JSON API for interacting with Bitcoin blockchain, accessed over HTTP or HTTPS from the api.bitchain.network domain. Currently, Bitchain supports Bitcoin and Bitcoin Testnet Chain.

All currency amounts are in units of satoshis (1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin).

# Documentation Structure

In these docs you'll find everything you need to leverage Bitchain for your applications. For all officially supported languages, you'll see code samples, in addition to basic cURL requests/responses for every endpoint. You can switch between cURL/language samples via the selector in the upper right. We're working on supporting more languages, but if you're working on your own language library, definitely let us know: we'd love to add more community supported libraries here.
